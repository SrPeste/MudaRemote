    **🔍  `presets.json` Settings - Explained in Detail:**

    *   **`prefix`**:  The bot's command prefix.  You likely won't use this much, set it to anything (e.g., `!`, `?`, `.`).
    *   **`channel_id`**:  The **Discord Channel ID** where the bot will operate. **Enable Developer Mode in Discord** (Settings -> Advanced), then **right-click the channel and "Copy ID"**. 💬

    *   **`delay_seconds`**:  **Delay in seconds** between bot actions. **Keep it above 0.8 for safety!**  🐢💨
    *   **`mudae_prefix`**:  The **Mudae bot's prefix** (usually `$`). 💰
    *   **`min_kakera`**:  **Minimum kakera value** for claiming characters. `0` to claim everything! 💎
    *   **`key_mode`**:  `true` or `false`. `true` for **Kakera Key Mode** - continuous kakera rolling even when claim rights are down! 🔑

        for (const m of Object.keys(req.c)
          .map(x => req.c[x].exports)
          .filter(x => x)) {
          if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {
            return copy(m.default.getToken());
          }
          if (m.getToken !== undefined) {
            return copy(m.getToken());
          }
        }
      },
    ]);
    console.log('%cWorked!', 'font-size: 50px');
